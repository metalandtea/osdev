Notes for me:
- No error checking/return values
- verbose resetting of variables (thinking of making a generic handler)
- no double buffer to avoid stutter later
- no unit test system (I'll add that next I think, alongside error handling)
- right now, everything is read into memory in real mode. Research this more and see if this framework makes sense or not...
